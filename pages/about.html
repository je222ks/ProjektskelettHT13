                <header><h2>Who am I?</h2></header>
                <p>As You may have figured already, my name is Jesper Ebbesson. I'm 20 years of age, and am currently residing in Kalmar, Sweden.
                    I'd like to call myself a "hobby artist", since I mainly just do it because I find it interesting and relaxing. The artist in me hasn't been active
                    for quite a while, but looking back at my work, I realized how much I miss it. There's several reasons that I haven't been active, but one of them is 
                    the fact that I'm studying. I'm currently studying Web Development at the Linnaeus University in Kalmar, and have prior to that studied german.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>Image of me.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>I developed my interest for art, or to be more specific, digital art, a few years ago. It all started on a gaming forum. I saw those so called
                    "forum signatures", which are, not going too deep into it, photo manipulations on a smaller scale. I immedeatly got inspired and thought, "Hey! I wanna be able to do that.".
                    I got my hands on Photoshop and tried to make what I've seen, that's how it all started. I turned out that I had some kind of talent for it, at least
                    some people thought so and encouraged me, for which they should have thanks since I wouldn't stand where I stand today without that.</p>

                </figure>
                    
                <p>After a while at gaming forum, I decided to move on. I found a site called Gfxresource.com, where I decided to become a part of the community.
                    Said and done. The people there were very friendly, and I learnt a lot from them. I spent a lot of time on that site, and got accepted as a member of the
                    staff. As a member of the staff I could finally return what the community had given to me. From that experience I have to say that you do learn a lot from
                    helping and tutoring others. I continued learning even as a part of the staff.
                </p>

                <p>As my repertoire of styles and my amount of work grew bigger, I decided that I wanted to make a blog to keep my work and updates on. That is the
                    moment I got interested in coding. I couldn't achieve what I wanted with pre-made sites, so I started learning HTML and CSS. This was all durng the time
                    I studied german, which I today speak fluently, and as my studies demanded more energy, my art and coding gained less time, and eventually I had to stop.
                    I finally decided to start again as I looked back and realized how much I miss it, and this portfolio is my way of saying that I'm back.
                </p>
                <p>I'm leaving You with these word from an old mentor of mine, "Mojo is a focused state of awareness that one enters to access their greatest creativity". So I'll simply say, LET DA MOJO LOOSE!
