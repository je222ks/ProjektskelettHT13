[Yet to be implemented](http://tstjostudent.github.io/Projektet)

*Working version is yet to be implemented*

## Project description
*The goal of my project is to create a portfolio for artwork. I've been wanting to create one for a while, but I never really had the knowledge for it.*
*So I basically saw this project as my opportunity to do that. Art is an interest of mine, and I want a place to showcase it.*
*By saying portfolio, I don't simply mean a one page showcase. I want to make it much more, but still leaving that as focus.*

## Techniques
*During my process of coding I will try to implement as much HTML5 and CSS3 as possible, as long as it's compatible.*
*As far as I'm concerned, I will not use any frameworks or CSS-Preprocessors. I feel that I want to, and need to, do it from scratch to get a better hang of it.*

*I will use myself of Adobe Photoshop and/or Adobe Illlustrator for creation of elements which can't be made, or are to hard to create with CSS.*

## Limitations
*There will probably be a thing or two I may skip or fake, due to the fact I do not possess knowledge for it as of now.*
*I'm not saying that I won't try to gain that knowledge, but if it's something too time-consuming, I will skip it since I simply don't have that time.*

*If I do get time, I may try to make a german and/or swedish version of my site, just to open it for a larger "audience" since the main language will be english. But this is just an "if".*

## Time Planning
[Time chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AugmizIl38RgdDhjV29jSXJxN2UyaUdBaTRiUDZiNXc&usp=sharing)

*I've chosen to put no time limit on the parts I chose to call Elements and Accesibility. There's a reason for that.*
*Accesibility is something I will keep in mind as I'm coding, since I find it more difficult to adjust that afterwards.*
*And well.. Elements simply run alongside since I can create those elements anytime. Probably mainly during the time I code CSS though, since those elements are meant as visual elements.*
